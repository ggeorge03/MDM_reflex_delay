Github Repository for MDM2 group2 project 2 : 
This project focused on Modelling human reflex delay with various control systems with a delay parameter : Pd controller, LQR and MPC.  


This was then compared to experimental data to see what was the most similar controller to humans.  

Requirements: matplotlib, scipy, numpy
